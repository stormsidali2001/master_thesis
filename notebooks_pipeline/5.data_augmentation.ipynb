The neural network is trained to predict the likelihood of observed sensor data given a potential robot pose, while the graphical model integrates these predictions over time to maintain a consistent map of the environment. This synergistic approach enables robust and accurate SLAM even in challenging conditions with significant sensor noise and dynamic objects.')}\n"
